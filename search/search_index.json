The tools provided by the awt are implemented using each platforms native GUI toolkit, hence preserving the look and feel of each platform. It is an advantage of awt. But the disadvantage of such an approach is that GUI designed on one platform may look different when displayed on another platform. Awt is the foundation upon which swing is made. AWT Hierarchy Component The component is an abstract class that encapsulates all the attributes of a visual Components. Except for menus, all user interface elements that are displayed on the screen and that interact with the user of subclasses of Component. A Component object is responsible for remembering the current foreground and background colors and the currently selected text font. Container The Container class is a subclass of Component class. It has additional methods that allow other Component objects to be nested within it. Other Container objects can be stored inside a Container(Since they are themselves an instance of Component). This makes for a multilevel containment system. A Container is responsible for laying out i.e. positioning any components that it contains. It does thus throw the use of various layout manager. Panel The panel is the Container that does not contain a title bar, menu bars, border. It can have other components like button text field, etc. The panel is the superclass for the applet. This is why you don't see title bar, menu bar or border when an applet is run inside a browser. When you run an applet using an applet viewer, the applet viewer provides the title and border. Other components can be added to a Panel objects by its add() method. Once this components have been added, you can position and resize them manually using the setLocation(), setSize(), setBounds(), etc. Window The Window is the Container that has no borders and menu bars. The Window class creates a top level window. A top level window is not contained within any other object. Generally, you won't create a Window object directly. Instead, you will use a subclass of Window called Frame. Frame The frame has a title bar, menu bar, borders and resizing corners. The precise look of a frame will differ from the environment. The frame is a Container that contains several different components like button, title, text field, label etc. In Java, most of the awt application is created using the frame window.","title":"Event, Event Handling & AWT/Swing"},{"location":"AWT/#event-event-handling-awtswing","text":"Also called javafx JFx","title":"Event, Event Handling &amp; AWT/Swing"},{"location":"AWT/#awt-abstract-window-toolkit","text":"AWT contains large numbers of classes and methods that allows you to create and manage graphical user interface(GUI) such as windows, buttons, scrollbars,textblocks ,etc. The awt was designed to provide a common set of tools for GUI design that could work on a variety of platforms.

An applet is a Java class that extends the java.applet.Applet . No main() method Applet was designed to be embedded with a HTML page. JVM is required to view an applet. Applet have strict security rules that are enforced by the web browser. Two types of Applet Based on Applet class These Applets use the Abstract Window Toolkit ( AWT ) to provide the graphical user interface (GUI). The style of applet has been available since Java was first created. Based on JApplet class They are based on the Swing class JApplet which inherits Applet. Swing applet use the swing classes to provide the GUI. Life Cycle of Applet Applet Initialization and Termination When an applet begins ,the following methods are called in this sequence : init() start() paint() Whenever an applet is terminated, the following sequence of methods calls takes place. stop() destroy() Description : init() The init( ) method is the first method to be called. This is where you should initialize variables. This method is called only once during the run time of your applet. start() The start( ) method is called after init( ) . It is also called to restart an applet after it has been stopped. Whereas init( ) is called once\u2014the first time an applet is loaded\u2014 start( ) is called each time an applet\u2019s HTML document is displayed onscreen. So, if a user leaves a web page and comes back, the applet resumes execution at start( ) . paint() The paint( ) method is called each time an AWT-based applet\u2019s output must be redrawn. This situation can occur for several reasons. Whatever the applet must redraw its output, paint( ) method is called. The paint( ) method has one parameter of type Graphics. stop() The stop( ) method is called when a web browser leaves the HTML document containing the applet\u2014when it goes to another page, for example. When stop( ) is called, the applet is probably running. You should use stop( ) to suspend threads that don\u2019t need to run when the applet is not visible. You can restart them when start( ) is called if the user returns to the page. destroy() The destroy( ) method is called when the environment determines that your applet needs to be removed completely from memory. At this point, you should free up any resources the applet may be using. The stop( ) method is always called before destroy( ) . The HTML APPLET Tag Syntax : <applet [codebase = codebaseURL] code = appletFile [alt = alternateText] [name = appletInstanceName] width = pixels height = pixels [align = alignment] [vspace = pixels] [hspace = pixels] > [< PARAM NAME = attributeName VALUE = AttributeValue>] >> Important for Exam \ud83d\udcaf [HTML Displayed in the absence of Java] </applet> Note : [ ] \u23e9 Optional CODEBASE It is an optional attribute that specifies the base URL of the applet code, which is the directory that will be searched for the applets executable class file. The HTML Document URL Directory is used as the CODEBASE if this attribute is not specified. CODE Code is the required attribute that gives the name of file containing compiled .class file. This file is related to the code base URL of the applet. ALT The ALT tag is an alternate tag used to specify a short text message that should be displayed if the browser recognized the applet tag but can't currently run JAVA applet. NAME NAME is an optional attribute used to specify a name for the applet instance. NAME attribute is used in order to communicate between applets on the same page. WIDTH and HEIGHT WIDTH and HEIGHT are the required attributes that gives the size of the applet display area. ALIGN ALIGN is an optional attribute that specifies the alignment of the applet. The possible values are LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, MIDDLE, BASELINE, TEXTTOP, ABSMIDDLE (Absolute Middle) and ABSBOTTOM (Absolute Bottom). VSPACE and HSPACE These attributes are optional. VSPACE specifies the space in pixel and below the applet. HSPACE specifies the space in pixel on each sides of the applet.

Events are generated as a result of user interaction with GUI components . But they can also be generated explicitly. For eg: Clicking on a button, moving the mouse, entering character through keyboard. What is Event Listener ? A Listener is an object that is notified when an event occurs. a.k.a Event Handler . (also known as) Listener is responsible for generating response to an event. It has two major requirements: First , it must have been registered with one or more source to receive notifications about specific types of events. It must implement methods to receive and process these notifications. What is Event Source ? A source is an object that generates an event. This occurs when the internal state of the object chages in some way. Source may generate more than one tyoe of event. A source must register listeners in order for the listeners to recieve notifications about specific type of event. Each type of event has its own registration method. Here is the general form. public void addTypeListener (TypeListener el) // el = event listener For eg: addKeyListener() Here Type is the name of the event and el is the reference to the event listener. When an event occurs, all registered listeners are notified and recieve a copy of event object. This is known as multicasting the event . Some sources may allow only one listener to register. When such an event occurs, the registered listener is notified. This is known as unicasting the event . A source must also provide method that allows a listener to unregister an interest in a specific type of event. The general form: public void removeTypeListener(TypeListener el) What is Event Handling ? It is the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen if an event occurs. Java Uses Event Delegation Model . Event Delegation Model Concept : A source generates an event and sends it to one or more listeners. The listener simply waits until it receives an event. Once an event is recieved, the listener processes the event and then returns. Advantages The advantages of this design is that the application logic that processes events is clearly separated from the UI logic that generates those events. Using the Delegation Event Model Steps 1. Implement the appropriate interface in the listener so that it can receive the type of event desired. 2.
